_Name_,

Another Seattle CoffeeOps member shared with me an email you sent to her which was unwelcome and inappropriate.

As a leader of the Seattle CoffeeOps, I have a responsibility to maintain a welcoming meet-up group.
Therefore, I will be removing you from the Seattle CoffeeOps meet-up group, effective immediately.

Doug Ireton
founder, Seattle CoffeeOps
