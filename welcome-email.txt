<Name>,

Thank you for joining the Seattle #CoffeeOps meet-up group. We're a welcoming community of folks who gather to talk about software development + operations (Dev + Ops) tools and culture in downtown Seattle.

I hope you'll join us Friday, <date> from 8:00 - 9:15AM for the next #CoffeeOps meet-up.

To promote a welcoming community, the CoffeeOps leadership team has adopted a
Code of Conduct (https://github.com/CoffeeOps/Seattle/blob/master/code-of-conduct.md).

What questions can I answer for you?

Cheers,

<Leader name>

Seattle #CoffeeOps leadership team
